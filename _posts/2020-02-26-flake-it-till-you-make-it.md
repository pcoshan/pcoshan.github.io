This project is a skill for amazon Alexa. This application interacts with NASA's Astronmy Picture of the Day API. Once this skill has been activated using the wake word/phrase "Alexa open Space Fact" an API call is made and a new astronmy fact take from the description of the APOD API is told to the user. This project was a first attempt at using the amazon developer tool kit to create alexa applications that can interact with external API's. The code for this project can be found on my GitHub [profile.](https://github.com/pcoshan?tab=repositories)
