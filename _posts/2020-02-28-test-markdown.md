The Project that i was working on was targeted towards improving students ability to develop algorithmic flow through refactoring.
During this time i perfromed: 
• Pattern evaluation of if/else statements from student’s code, examining this data to develop
techniques to improve teaching of these concepts to students new to programming.
• Refactored code from previous practical examination of intermediate level problem solving
questions to help develop a quantitative method for refactoring of short programs.
