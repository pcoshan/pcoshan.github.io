The project that I was working on was targeted towards improving students ability to develop algorithmic flow through refactoring.
During this time I performed: 
* Pattern evaluation of if/else statements from studentâ€™s code, examining this data to develop
techniques to improve teaching of these concepts to students new to programming.
* Refactored code from previous practical examination of intermediate level problem solving
questions to help develop a quantitative method for refactoring of short programs.
